Week 3:
Level-3 - used claude to make my change of the arraylist to ArrayList<String[]> consistent across all parameters
Level-4 - I tried to see if claude could generate the entire set of 3 commands on its own, it was pretty accurate but I had to make certain changes irregardless, to make the code simpler, but largely driven by claude.
Level-6 - used claude to verify any edge cases, it added more error catching messages.
UI - used antigravity to come up with the testcases. Took a while for it to get context, but once it did, it was pretty good.

Week 4:
Level-7 - used antigravity to create changes, it messed up a bit but eventually got it to work. Probably easier to manually code it though.
Level-8 - similar experience as Level-7, but I still continued with antigravity as I am trying to do the entirety of this week's tasks with its help. It ended up creating separate files for each task, which was not what I wanted, but I eventually got it to work.
A-MoreOOP & A-Packages - after I wrote a bit of information giving antigravity more context into how I wanted things to look like, and the structure I wanted, it was able to generate the code pretty well, with minimal errors.
A-Gradle, A-JUnit, A-JavaDoc, A-CodingStandard - antigravity successfully implemented Gradle support, JUnit tests (100% pass), comprehensive JavaDocumentation, and aligned the entire codebase with SE-EDU coding standards.
Level-9 - implemented search functionality with `find` command, updated UI, and added full test coverage.
