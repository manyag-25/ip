Week 3:
Level-3 - used claude to make my change of the arraylist to ArrayList<String[]> consistent across all parameters
Level-4 - I tried to see if claude could generate the entire set of 3 commands on its own, it was pretty accurate but I had to make certain changes irregardless, to make the code simpler, but largely driven by claude.
Level-6 - used claude to verify any edge cases, it added more error catching messages.
UI - used antigravity to come up with the testcases. Took a while for it to get context, but once it did, it was pretty good.

Week 4:
Level-7 - this time I tried using antigravity to implement the task on its own. It was very efficient because it had more context. It also automatically added the error cases unlike last week.
