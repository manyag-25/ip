# Duke User Guide

Mercury is a personal assistant that tracks todos, deadlines, events, and keeps you motivated with cheerful reminders.

## Help command

Use the `help` command inside the CLI or GUI to see a curated list of supported commands. The help screen also appears directly inside the new Mercury UI, so you can always reference the syntax before typing a command.

## Adding deadlines

Describe the action (e.g., `deadline submit report /by 2026-03-05`) and the assistant will remind you with the due date. The CLI shows the same output as the GUI, so both interfaces stay consistent.

## UI refresh

The JavaFX client now reuses a stylesheet with gradients, pill-shaped inputs, and dialog box styling. Visual cues (colored bubbles, drop shadows) keep the assistant friendly while still matching the command-line copy that the helper prints out.
